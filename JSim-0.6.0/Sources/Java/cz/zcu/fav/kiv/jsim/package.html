<body>
This package provides basic classes for simulation creation and execution.
The basic classes are JSimSimulation, JSimProcess, JSimHead, and JSimLink.

You should start with creating a JSimSimulation object. Then, any created
JSimProcess or JSimHead shoul have your simulation object as its parent.
The activities of your processes are described in their life() methods.
The simulation can be executed in a step-by-step manner by repeated invocation
of its step() method.
