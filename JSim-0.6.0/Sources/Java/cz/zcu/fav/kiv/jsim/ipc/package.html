<body>
This package provides classes for simulation of inter-process communication.
Inter-process communication involves process synchronization by semaphores
and message passing. All kinds of message passing are supported: messages can be
symmetric, assymetric, or indirect. Methods sending/receiving a message can block
the calling process or not. Indirect message passing is realized via message boxes.
